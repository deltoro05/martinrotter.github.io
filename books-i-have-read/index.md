I love reading books. Particularly books about history, books about Russian life during WWII, books about Sherlock Holmes and many other genres. You can check list of books I have read [here](/assets/2016/07/my-books.pdf). Note that the list is probably not complete. It does not include books which are not in my Calibre.
