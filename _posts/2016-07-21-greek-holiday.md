Some months ago, me and my family have decided to go to our first real abroad holiday.
<!--more-->

We chose Greece and found interesting offer from travel agency. They said, that our holiday will not be hosted by standard hotel. We will be staying in lonely area, in very small guesthouse-like hotel [Marietta Studios](https://www.google.cz/maps/place/Marietta+Studios+Zante+Zakynthos/@37.8321726,20.8306346,15.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb0df501e35d557f5!8m2!3d37.834462!4d20.828275). It is located on Zakynthos island, on east side of the island.
