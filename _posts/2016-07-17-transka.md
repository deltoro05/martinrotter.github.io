<p>Transka is very simple <a href="https://www.transifex.com/">Transifex</a> API wrapper written in pure Bash. All code is contained withing single Bash script called <code>transka</code>. Transka is available on <a href="https://github.com/martinrotter/transka">GitHub</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Transka offers limited functionality via calling the script with various arguments, including downloading and uploading of both resource files and translations of resource files. These features are enough for managing existing translations.</p>

<p>To list all available switches, simply call <code>transka --help</code>. Transka allows doing all those actions via single script call.</p><p>I use transka in my personal project, RSS Guard, for download translations and updating source resource localization file with single script. Check <a href="https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/blob/master/resources/scripts/update-localizations.sh">it out</a>.</p>
